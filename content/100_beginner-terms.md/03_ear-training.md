## Pitch Recognition Exercises

Learning solfege involves honing your ability to recognize pitches accurately. A good way to do this is by doing pitch recognition exercises. These exercises teach you to listen to musical notes and name the matching solfege syllable. With pitch recognition exercises, you can build the foundation of practical ear training, a vital skill for any musician. 

You can easily find exercises for these online. However, we personally prefer a structured process, as the [Function Ear Trainer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaizen9.fet.android) provides. Another way to practice is to play a note on an instrument and use our app and try to sing the corresponding solfege syllable.

Consistent practice will improve your ability to recognize pitches and sing in tune.

## Melodic Dictation Using Solfege

Taking your aural skills to the next level requires consistent practice and dedication. A great way to develop these skills is through melodic dictation, a process where you listen to a melody and transcribe it using solfege syllables. Melodic dictation is a crucial part of ear training as it helps you recognize pitch intervals, chord progressions, and melodies, which are all important for music composition and performance.

Before you begin melodic dictation, you need to know solfege syllables well and be able to sing them with ease. After that, you listen to short melodies while naming the notes using solfege syllables. It might be hard at first, but with regular practice, you will develop your skill in writing down musical notes correctly.

There are many resources available online that offer exercises and tools for practicing melodic dictation in solfege. One of our favorites is the tool by [tonesavvy.com](https://tonesavvy.com/music-practice-exercise/222/melodic-dictation-ear-training/). This tool allows you to listen to short melodies and then transcribe them using solfege syllables. It also provides instant feedback on your accuracy and helps you track your progress over time.
