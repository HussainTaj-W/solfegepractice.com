## Ear Training in Music

If you aspire to be a musician or singer, ear training is a fundamental practice.
Ear training (also known as aural skills) allows you to perceive, identify, and understand various elements of music solely by listening.

Have you ever wondered how some talented musicians can hear a melody once and then play it on their instrument without effort?
It's thanks to their amazing aural skills. Anyone can learn these skills and even develop a deeper understanding
of music.
