## Basics of Musical Notation

Before diving into solfege, it's essential to grasp the basics of musical notation. Familiarize yourself with the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)), [symbols representing notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols), [clefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clef), and [key signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature). This foundation will make your solfege journey more enjoyable and effective.

## Introduction to Solfege Syllables

Solfege assigns syllables (do, re, mi, etc.) to musical notes, providing a vocal framework for understanding and reproducing melodies. Begin with the core syllables and gradually expand your repertoire.

Some common syllables are:

- `Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti`
- `C  D  E  F  G  A  B`
- `Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Da Ni`
- `1  2  3  4  5  6  7`

In one set of syllables, each syllable represents a pitch or musical note.
