## Pitch Recognition Exercises

Learning solfege involves honing your ability to recognize pitches accurately. You should do some pitch recognition exercises where you listen to musical notes and identify the corresponding solfege syllables. These exercises form the basis of effective ear training, a crucial skill for any musician.

You can easily find exercises for these online. However, we personally prefer a structured process like the [Function Ear Trainer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaizen9.fet.android) provides.

## Melodic Dictation Using Solfege

Take your aural skills to the next level by practicing melodic dictation. Listen to a melody, identify the notes using solfege, and transcribe it. This challenging yet rewarding exercise enhances your ear's sensitivity to musical nuances and strengthens your connection between solfege syllables and actual pitches.
