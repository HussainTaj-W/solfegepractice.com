Everyone has seen a piano in one form or another. If you can recognize a piano when you see it, you're ready to read this article. We will use the piano as an example to demonstrate different concepts. That being said, this knowledge applies to all types of instruments that follow the Western music style.

## Note

A note is a single sound in a musical composition (song). When you press a single key on the piano, you play a specific note.

In Western music, there are 12 notes. The following image shows the piano buttons labeled with their corresponding notes.

> Did you realize something? Yes! The piano has a repeating pattern. This pattern consists of 12 repeating buttons.


## Octave

Remember the group of 12 notes we talked about earlier? That group is an octave.

> The technical definition of an octave is a bit tricky to explain right now, we'll leave it for you to discover on your own.

## Key

In a piano, all the buttons are also known as keys. However, in a musical composition, a key refers to the base of the group of notes, which were used to compose the song. We'll talk more about this when we explain scales.

## Interval

An interval is the difference in the frequency of any two notes. This forms the basis of what a tone and semitone are.

## Semintone

A semitone is the smallest possible interval. On a piano, this will be the difference between two adjacent buttons.

## Tone

A tone is an interval of two semitones.

## Scale

A scale is a group of notes. The notes of this group are picked using some set of rules. The notes group often has a base note called the key.

With this knowledge, you are ready to read more literature on music. This should be enough for you to read the literature on this website. However, to learn more advance theory, you'll have to gain a deeper understanding of each of these concepts and more.
