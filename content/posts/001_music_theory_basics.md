Everyone has seen a piano in one form or another. If you can recognize a piano when you see it, you're ready to read this article. We will use the Piano as an example to demonstrate different concepts.

## Note

A note is a single sound in a musical composition (song). When you press a single key on the piano, you play a specific note.

## Key

In a piano, all the buttons are also known as keys. However, in a musical composition, a key refers to the base of the group of notes, which were used to compose the song. We'll talk more about this when we explain scales.

## Interval

An interval is the difference in the frequency of any two notes.

## Semintone

A semitone is the smallest position interval. On a piano, this will be the difference between two adjacent keys.

## Tone

A tone is an interval of two semitones. 

## Scale

A scale is a group of notes. The notes of this group are picked using some set of rules. The notes group often has a base note called the key.
